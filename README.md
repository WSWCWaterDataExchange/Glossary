# Glossary
An ontology of water, data, and internal IoW concepts, with definitions and provenance

# Overall organization

There are three components of the Internet of Water Glossary (new name reccomended by the Board of Advisors TBD)

1. A vocabulary management system where terms are ingested. We use [VocBench3](http://vocbench.uniroma2.it/). Our version can be found [here](http://purl.org/iow/vocbench3). It is a docker image of VocBench v.3.6.0.0 (see our [repository](https://github.com/internetofwater/docker-vocbench3))
