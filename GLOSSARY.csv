Although led at the State level and initially funded by bond money from Propositions 1E (2006) and 84 (2006), FloodSAFE implementation relies on the cooperation and assistance of federal partners, tribal entities, local sponsors, and other stakeholders. The FloodSAFE vision is a sustainable system of flood management, with an integrated water management approach and emergency response throughout California, which improves public safety, protects and enhances environmental and cultural resources, and supports economic growth by reducing the probability of destructive floods, promoting beneficial floodplain processes, and lowering the damages caused by flooding.","CA-DWR Glossary","https://water.ca.gov/Water-Basics/Glossary","CA-DWR","Legal and Regulatory"
